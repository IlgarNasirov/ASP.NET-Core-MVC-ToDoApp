This is a to do web project where you can do all CRUD operations on your todos. You just need to sign up and sign in for that. I used bcrypt(for hashing password), Entity Framework Core(as ORM framework), Microsoft SQL Server(as database), Gmail SMTP Server(for verify account and forgot password), jQuery(for server side validation) and so on.
