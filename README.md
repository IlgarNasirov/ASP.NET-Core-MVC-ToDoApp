This is a to do web project where you can do all CRUD operations on your todos. You just need to sign up and sign in for that. I used bcrypt(for hashing password), Entity Framework Core(as an ORM framework) with code first approach, Microsoft SQL Server(as a database), Gmail SMTP Server(for verifying account and forgetting password), jQuery(for client side validation), session(for authorization) and so on.
